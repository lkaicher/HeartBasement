LICENCE NOTES

This version of PowerQuest uses the MIT license, so in short:
 - You are free to use PowerQuest, for any purpose.
 - You can study how PowerQuest works and change it.
 - Games you make with PowerQuest are your own. They do not fall under PowerQuest's license terms and copyright. You're free to do whatever you like with them.
 - You can share the source code of your own games/content, including sharing PowerQuest files/source code. The only restriction is that you need to distribute this copyright notice and license statement whenever you redistribute it. ie. Don't remove this file.
 - This means you CAN NOT just put PowerQuest up on the unity asset store, as then it would fall under unity's asset store license, not this one, and is therefore forbidden.
