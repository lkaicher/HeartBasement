		AGS users are familiar with the SetTimer() function, which is why it is included. However, it's good to know how to make your own timers, it's a fundamental building block of game coding! 

		This is how most coders would implement a simple timer:

		In your script body or header, add a float variable: `float m_myTimer = 0;`

		When you want to start a timer, in an interaction script for example: `m_myTimer = 4; // Set to 4 seconds`

		And in your Update function:
		
			if ( m_myTimer > 0) // If the timer is started
			{
				m_myTimer -= Time.deltaTime; // Subtract the time since last update
				if ( m_myTimer <= 0 ) // Check if the timer's elapsed
				{
					// The timer has elapsed! Do something!

	-  you can add the [QuestSave] attribute to the class
		- When you do that, ONLY the variables that also have the [QuestSave] attribute are saved.
		- You can put this tag on a Monobehaviour class, when you just want to save a few of its variables without having to put them in their own seperate class
